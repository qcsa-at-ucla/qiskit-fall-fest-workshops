# Qiskit Fall Fest Workshops

Welcome to the UCLA Qiskit Fall Fest workshop materials! This repository contains hands-on Jupyter notebook labs designed to help participants learn quantum computing with IBM Qiskit, from fundamentals to advanced applications.

## Workshop Labs

This repository includes three progressive workshop labs:

### üü¢ Beginner: Qiskit Fundamentals Lab
**File:** `qiskit_fundamentals_lab-2.ipynb`

A comprehensive introduction to Qiskit 2 fundamentals covering 18 core concepts through hands-on exercises. Perfect for those new to quantum computing or Qiskit.

**Topics covered:**
- Pauli operators and single-qubit operations
- Quantum circuits and gates
- Quantum state visualization
- Circuit simulation with Qiskit Aer
- Parameter handling and circuit composition
- Basic quantum algorithms

### üü° Intermediate: DiVincenzo Criteria Lab
**File:** `divincenzo_criteria_lab-2 (Intermediate).ipynb`

Explore the fundamental requirements for building a quantum computer through DiVincenzo's five criteria. This lab provides practical demonstrations using Qiskit to understand what makes quantum computing possible.

**Topics covered:**
- Scalable physical systems and qubit characterization
- Qubit initialization and state preparation
- Decoherence times and quantum coherence (T‚ÇÅ, T‚ÇÇ)
- Universal quantum gate sets
- Qubit measurement capabilities
- Running circuits on simulators vs. real IBM Quantum devices

### üî¥ Advanced: Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) Lab
**File:** `SQD lab (Advanced) .ipynb`

Dive into cutting-edge quantum algorithms for chemistry applications. Learn how to compute ground state energies of molecules using sampling-based quantum diagonalization methods.

**Topics covered:**
- Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD)
- Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD)
- Ansatz design and comparison
- Molecular Hamiltonian construction
- Ground state energy calculations for N‚ÇÇ molecules
- Real quantum hardware execution (~2 min QPU time)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- IBM Quantum account (for running on real quantum hardware)

### Installation
Each notebook contains installation instructions for the required packages. Generally, you'll need:

```bash
pip install qiskit[visualization] qiskit-ibm-runtime qiskit-aer
```

For the advanced lab, additional packages are required:
```bash
pip install ffsim qiskit-addon-sqd
```

### Usage
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the desired notebook in Jupyter
3. Follow the instructions within each notebook
4. Complete the exercises and ask any questions as you progress
